"""Parse ETC1, a terrible 4x4 block-based image compression format.

Please enjoy the docs.
https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/OES/OES_compressed_ETC1_RGB8_texture.txt

The format supported here isn't actually ETC1, but a Nintendo-flavored variant
that decodes four 4x4 blocks one 8x8 block at a time, because of course it is.
(I believe the 3DS operates with 8x8 tiles, so this does make some sense.)
